        <h2>Welcome!</h2>
        <p>Welcome to the official Peruvian tourism guide! Here, you can learn all about Peru, 
            their cities, their culture,<br>their foods, and get help with planning your trip!
            Peru is a beautiful country with a rich history deeply rooted<br>in their indigenous
            people, who had endured for centuries in the lands of modern day Peru. Their lands 
            are<br>also commonly considered to be divided into 3 sections,
            the coast, the mountains and the jungle. Here, we<br>will go over these 3 sections,
            talk about the history of Peru, and much more!

        <h2>Peruvian Geography</h2>
        <p>As mentioned before, the geography of Peru is considered to be split into three 
            sections: the coast,<br>the mountains, and the jungle. Here, we'll go into a 
            short summary of each of these sections, their<br>terrains and their climates.
        </p>
        <h3>Coast</h3>
        <p>The coast spans the entire West side of Peru, and has a desert like climate and 
            terrain.<br>The Pacific ocean is known for being notoriously cold, and for 
            having rough waves. Because of this,<br>the beaches of Peru are a mix of 
            beautiful and calm warm waves, to other rocky and rough beaches.<br>The 
            Northern beaches are generally warmer and calmer, while the Southern beaches 
            more<br>commonly have rocky grounds and rough waves. Around 40% of Peru's 
            population lives within<br>the coast, with a majority of them residing in the
            capital city of Lima.
        </p>
        <h3>Mountains</h3>
        <p>The mountains of Peru are part of the Andes mountain range. Their mountains are 
            a rough, and cold<br>region which splits the coast of Peru and the jungle. Unlike 
            the dry coasts, the mountains of Peru<br>are full of green valleys, whitecapped 
            peaks and lots of high altitude ecosystems. Peru's highest peak<br>is the Huascarán, 
            which is a mountain peak that stands at 6,768 meters (22,205 feet). About 36% of
            <br>Peru's population lives within the mountains.
        </p>
        <h3>Jungle</h3>
        <p>The jungle of Peru is part of the Amazon Rainforest, which spans across all of central
            South America.<br>The Peruvian jungle is a lush, dense green environment which is full
            of all kinds of life. From jaguars to<br>pumas, sloths, monkeys, and all kinds of mammals,
            the Peruvian jungle is a biodiverse ecosystem which<br>attracts explorers, bird watchers, 
            and scientists all alike. With over 1,000 bird species, numerous<br>mammal and reptile species,
            and various amphibious species which reside in the Amazon River,<br>you will always find 
            something new in the jungles of Peru.

        <h2>History of Peru</h2>
        <p>Peru's history can date way back to ancient civilizations long before the Inca Empire.
            Cultures such as the<br>Norte Chico, Chavín, Nazca, and Moche contributed to early
            advancements in architecture, agriculture,<br>and art. Later, the powerful Inca Empire
            rose to dominance in the Andes, with Cusco as its capital and<br>Machu Picchu as one
            of its most famous cities. The Incas built an extensive network of roads and<br>terraces,
            and their influence stretched across much of western South America. Even after the 
            empire<br>declined, Peru's ancient cultures continue to shape its identity, from 
            traditions and crafts to language<br>and cuisine.
