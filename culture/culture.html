      <h2>Peruvian Culture</h2>
      <p> 
          Peru's culture is a rich blend of indigenous traditions and Spanish 
          influences. From<br>colorful festivals to traditional dances, Peru's 
          heritage is celebrated year-round<br>in cities and villages alike.
          Music and food play a vital role in daily life, with instruments<br> 
          like the pan flute and dishes like ceviche symbolizing the nation's 
          identity. Here,<br>you can get a summary of some events, some 
          traditions, some foods, and the general<br>gist of Peruvian culture!

      <h2>Peruvian Cuisine</h2>
      <p>
          Peru is celebrated worldwide for its extraordinary culinary 
          diversity, blending indigenous traditions with Spanish, 
          African, Chinese, and Japanese influences. Ceviche, the 
          country's iconic dish, features fresh raw fish marinated in 
          lime juice, spiced with chili peppers, and served with sweet 
          potatoes and corn. Other famous specialties include lomo 
          saltado, a savory stir-fry of beef, tomatoes, onions, and 
          French fries, and ají de gallina, a creamy chicken dish 
          enriched with walnuts, cheese, and Peruvian yellow peppers. 
          Peru's desserts, like mazamorra morada made from purple corn, 
          are equally cherished for their rich flavors and local 
          ingredients.

      <p>
          Street food culture thrives in cities and villages alike. 
          Vendors serve anticuchos — marinated beef heart skewers 
          grilled over open flames — alongside tamales, fried yucca, 
          and picarones, which are doughnut-like pastries drizzled 
          with spiced syrup. The country's beverage traditions are also 
          unique, with chicha morada, a sweet drink made from purple 
          corn, and pisco sour, a national cocktail made with pisco 
          brandy, lime juice, egg white, and bitters.

      <h2>Festivals and Celebrations</h2>
      <p>
          Peruvians take great pride in their festivals, which are 
          vibrant reflections of religious devotion, agricultural cycles, 
          and historic customs. The Inti Raymi festival, held every June 
          in Cusco, reenacts Incan rituals honoring Inti, the sun god. 
          Thousands gather to watch costumed dancers, musicians, and 
          actors parade through ancient streets and perform ceremonies 
          at the Sacsayhuamán fortress. During February's Carnival, towns 
          across the country burst into celebration with water fights, 
          bright costumes, music, and regional dances. You can learn more
          about Cusco on our <a href="../cities/cusco.html">Cusco</a> page!

      <p>
          Among the most significant religious events is the Lord of 
          Miracles procession in Lima. Each October, massive crowds 
          dressed in purple accompany a centuries-old mural of Christ 
          through the capital's streets. It's considered the largest 
          Catholic procession in South America, drawing believers from 
          across the country and abroad. Other beloved events include the 
          Virgen del Carmen in Paucartambo and Corpus Christi in Cusco, 
          which feature elaborately dressed saints, traditional dances, 
          and lively music.
      </p>
      <h2>Traditional Dances</h2>
      <p>
          Dance is a central aspect of Peruvian identity, serving as both 
          entertainment and a way to honor cultural roots. The Marinera, 
          known as Peru's national dance, symbolizes courtship and 
          flirtation between a couple, who move gracefully while waving 
          handkerchiefs in the air. The Huayno, a highland favorite, 
          blends indigenous rhythms with Spanish melodies and is often 
          performed at weddings, festivals, and family gatherings. Its 
          quick, bouncing steps reflect the spirit and resilience of 
          Andean communities.

      <p>
          Coastal Peru celebrates its African heritage through the Festejo 
          and Landó, energetic dances accompanied by cajón drums, guitars, 
          and clapping. The central highlands feature the Scissors Dance 
          (Danza de las Tijeras), a competitive and acrobatic performance 
          where dancers display feats of balance, agility, and stamina while 
          holding iron scissors in each hand, often performing for hours as 
          a test of endurance and devotion.

      <h2>Traditional Clothing</h2>
      <p>
          Peruvian traditional clothing is a vivid expression of regional 
          identity and cultural pride. In the high Andes, women wear brightly 
          colored, layered skirts called polleras, often embroidered with 
          intricate patterns representing nature, animals, and spiritual 
          beliefs. These are paired with elaborately decorated blouses and 
          shawls known as llicllas, which are fastened with silver or bone 
          pins. Men commonly wear woolen ponchos in bold colors and 
          chullos — distinctive earflap hats made from alpaca or sheep's wool 
          to guard against the cold mountain air.

      <p> 
          Each village has unique color palettes and motifs, with designs and 
          weaving techniques passed down through generations. In the Amazon, 
          traditional attire incorporates feathers, seeds, and natural fibers, 
          reflecting the deep connection between Indigenous groups and the 
          rainforest. Even in modern cities, traditional garments remain an 
          essential part of religious festivals and folk celebrations, 
          symbolizing continuity and respect for ancestral ways of life.
      </p>
      <h2>Handicrafts and Art</h2>
      <p>
          Peru's artistic traditions are rooted in thousands of years of 
          history, from the pre-Incan civilizations to contemporary artisans. 
          The Andean regions are renowned for their textiles, woven from alpaca, 
          llama, or vicuña wool using natural dyes made from plants, minerals, 
          and insects. Artisans craft vibrant blankets, scarves, and garments 
          featuring geometric and symbolic designs that tell stories of mythology, 
          agriculture, and family lineage.
      </p>
      <div class="image-section">

      </div>
      <p>
          In addition to textiles, Peru is famous for its pottery, silverwork, 
          and wood carvings. Cusco and Ayacucho produce detailed retablos — portable 
          altarpieces depicting religious scenes, legends, and everyday life inside 
          brightly painted wooden boxes. In Lima and Arequipa, silversmiths create 
          finely detailed jewelry, while the Amazon's Indigenous communities produce 
          baskets, musical instruments, and ceremonial masks from forest materials. 
          These handicrafts are cherished not just as souvenirs, but as living 
          expressions of Peru's rich cultural heritage.
