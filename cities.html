    <h2>Cities</h2>
    <p>There are various cities strewn out throughout the various regions of Peru.
        Some reside in the mountains,<br>some in the jungle, and a majority of them 
        on the coast. Here are some of the most notable cities of Peru.
    </p>
    <h3>Coast</h3>
    <h4>Lima</h4>
    <p>Lima is the capital city of Peru, and the most populous city in the country. 
        With a beautiful beach,<br>green cliffs and a vast city skyline, Lima is usually
        the first stop for anyone eager to visit Peru. Founded in 1535,<br>Lima has seen
        centuries of history, from its modern foundation by the Spanish, to then the
        Viceroyalty of Peru,<br>it is a cultural landmark and the most notable city in Peru's
        history. Lima is the center of Peru which features a<br>little bit of everything within
        the city. If you're looking for beautiful beaches, to try the best Peruvian dishes,<br> 
        to learn about Peruvian history and visit historic museums, or to visit the grand Magic 
        Water Circuit park, then<br>Lima is the spot to begin!
    </p>
    <h3>Mountains</h3>
    <h4>Cusco</h4>
    <p>A historic city nestled 3,400 meters (11,150 feet) within the vast mountains, the city of 
        Cusco was once the<br>capital of the Inca Empire, so no wonder its a center for Incan 
        history and culture. From beautiful architecture<br>which was retained from colonial 
        structures, a grand city center, and with Machu Piccu just around the corner,<br>this 
        city is the first spot for a trekker's dream. Explorers usually arrive for the long 
        journey to Machu Picchu,<br>or to visit the Rainbow Mountain, yet Cusco itself has a 
        lot to offer visitors. Cusco is a city closely tied to its<br>people's beliefs, and there 
        are various cathedrals which boast beautiful art and are open to worshippers.<br>In terms
        of history, there are various museums around the city which are dedicated to Peruvian 
        and<br>Incan history, as well as the city of Cusco itself. The outskirts of Cusco also have
        lots of Incan ruins, which you<br>can visit for yourself, like the ruins of Tambomachay, or 
        of Sacsayhuamán.
    </p>
    <h3>Jungle</h3>
    <h4>Iquitos</h4>
    <p>Iquitos is a unique city nestled within the deep Amazon jungle, and surrounded by the 
        Amazon River. It isn't as<br>modern as Lima or Arequipa, but this is what makes visiting 
        Iquitos such an interesting and unique experience.<br>From markets which float on water, 
        to unique cusines, Iquitos is sure to leave you surprised with all new<br>experiences. 
        Iquitos is only accessible by boat or plane, so be sure to plan accordingly. In Iquitos, 
        you can take<br>a boat ride on the Amazon River, and experience its biodiverse ecosystem 
        for yourself. You can spot animals<br>such as pink dolphins, boas, piranhas, and many 
        other amphibious creatures. 15 minutes from Iquitos, you can<br>visit Monkey Island, an 
        island where monkeys live freely. You can see species like the capuchin<br>and woolly 
        monkeys. If history and culture interests you, there are many unique experiences to be 
        had with<br>indigenous communities and tour guides strewn throughout the city. In terms of food, 
        you can try grilled<br>fish fresh from the river, try Tacacho, a plantain dish made with 
        fresh green plantains, or even try Suri, a unique<br>dish of grilled grubs. While it sounds
        crazy, this dish is common to Iquitos, and some people even travel to the<br>city to solely
        try this dish. Nevertheless, there are new experiences galore in Iquitos.
