        <h2>Cusco</h2>
          <p>
          Cusco, located in the southeastern Andes of Peru, is one of the country's most 
          historically significant and picturesque cities. It was once the capital of the 
          vast Inca Empire before the Spanish conquest in the 16th century. Today, Cusco 
          is celebrated as a UNESCO World Heritage site and serves as the gateway to 
          Machu Picchu and the Sacred Valley. The city seamlessly blends ancient Incan 
          stonework with Spanish colonial architecture, offering visitors a unique 
          cultural experience.
          </p>
          <p>
          At an elevation of about 3,400 meters (11,200 feet), Cusco is surrounded by 
          scenic mountain landscapes, traditional villages, and remarkable archaeological 
          sites. Beyond its rich history, Cusco is a lively destination filled with 
          colorful festivals, local markets, and delicious Andean cuisine. It remains a 
          favorite destination for history enthusiasts, nature lovers, and travelers 
          seeking to experience Peru's indigenous heritage.

          Here are some highlights of what to do in the city:
          </p>
          <p>
          1. Explore the Plaza de Armas — Cusco's main square is the heart of the city 
          and a perfect starting point for visitors. Surrounded by colonial arcades, 
          churches, and cafes, the plaza is a lively spot for people-watching and local 
          celebrations. Key landmarks include the Cusco Cathedral and the Church of the 
          Society of Jesus.

          </div>          
          <p>
          2. Visit the Sacsayhuamán Fortress — Just a short hike from the city center, 
          this impressive Inca fortress is known for its massive stone walls made of 
          precisely cut boulders. The site also offers panoramic views of Cusco and is 
          a popular spot for the annual Inti Raymi (Festival of the Sun) celebration.
          </p>
          <p>
          3. Discover the Qorikancha (Temple of the Sun) — Once the most important temple 
          of the Inca Empire, Qorikancha was dedicated to Inti, the sun god. Although much 
          of the original Incan structure was destroyed by the Spanish, the site remains 
          an incredible example of Incan stone masonry combined with colonial architecture 
          from the Santo Domingo Convent.
          </p>
          <p>
          4. Shop at San Pedro Market — This bustling local market is perfect for 
          experiencing Cusco's vibrant daily life. Visitors can browse stalls selling fresh 
          produce, handmade textiles, souvenirs, and traditional Andean foods. It's a great 
          spot to try local snacks and interact with local artisans.
          </p>
          <p>
          5. Take a Day Trip to the Sacred Valley — The Sacred Valley, located just outside 
          Cusco, is home to charming villages, terraced hillsides, and ancient Inca sites 
          like Pisac and Ollantaytambo. The region is also famous for traditional markets, 
          scenic views, and adventure activities such as hiking and rafting.
          </p>
          <p>
          6. Enjoy Traditional Peruvian Cuisine — Cusco is known for its hearty Andean dishes. 
          Popular local specialties include alpaca steak, cuy (guinea pig), quinoa soup, and 
          chicha morada, a traditional drink made from purple corn. Many restaurants in Cusco 
          also offer panoramic views of the city alongside their meals.

          Cusco is also the gateway to the world-famous Machu Picchu. Most travelers begin 
          their journey to the ancient Inca citadel from Cusco, either by train or by embarking 
          on popular treks like the Inca Trail. The city's close proximity to this Wonder of the 
          World makes it a central hub for adventure seekers and history enthusiasts alike.
