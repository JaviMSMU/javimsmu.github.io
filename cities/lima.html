      <h2>Lima</h2>
        <p>
          Lima, the capital and largest city of Peru, is located along the Pacific coast, 
          in the central part of the country. It is not only a bustling metropolis but 
          also the cultural and political center of Peru. Known for its rich history, 
          vibrant culture, and exceptional gastronomy, Lima offers a unique blend of 
          old-world charm and modern innovation. Lima was founded on January 18, 1535, by 
          the Spanish conquistador Francisco Pizarro. Originally named "The City of Kings" 
          (La Ciudad de los Reyes), Lima served as the capital of the Viceroyalty of Peru
           during the Spanish colonial era. This city became a major center for Spanish 
           rule in South America, and many of the historical buildings and monuments in 
           the city date back to this colonial period.

          Over the centuries, Lima has evolved into a melting pot of cultures. It has 
          witnessed the rise and fall of empires, economic booms, and political unrest. 
          Despite these challenges, Lima has maintained its importance as Peru's cultural 
          and economic heart. Today, Lima is known for its mix of colonial architecture, 
          modern skyscrapers, and vibrant districts, all of which tell the story of its 
          diverse history. Lima is a city that offers a bit of everything — from historical 
          landmarks to modern attractions.
