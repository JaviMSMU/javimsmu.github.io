      <h2>Iquitos</h2>
        <p>
        Iquitos, located in northeastern Peru, is the largest city in the Peruvian 
        Amazon and one of the most unique destinations in the country. It's known 
        as the world's largest city unreachable by road — accessible only by boat 
        or plane. Surrounded by dense rainforest and mighty rivers, Iquitos serves 
        as a gateway for exploring the Amazon River and its remarkable biodiversity.
        </p>
        <p>
        Founded during the rubber boom of the late 19th century, Iquitos still 
        showcases remnants of colonial-era mansions and colorful street life. 
        The city's culture blends indigenous Amazonian traditions with modern 
        Peruvian influences, making it a fascinating stop for adventurers and nature 
        lovers alike.

        Here are some highlights of what to do in the city:
        </p>
        <p>
        1. Explore the Belén District — One of the most distinctive neighborhoods in 
        Iquitos, Belén is known for its stilted houses and floating markets. During 
        the rainy season, homes and shops rise on wooden stilts as the river water 
        flows beneath them. Visitors can take a boat ride through the flooded streets 
        and experience this unique way of life.

        <p>
        2. Take a River Tour on the Amazon — Iquitos is the perfect launching point 
        for river cruises and boat tours along the Amazon River. Visitors can spot 
        pink river dolphins, sloths, monkeys, and exotic birds while navigating through 
        the dense jungle waterways. Multi-day excursions into the rainforest often 
        include guided hikes, wildlife spotting, and visits to indigenous communities.

        <p>
        3. Visit the Manatee Rescue Center — A short trip from the city, this 
        conservation facility rehabilitates orphaned and injured Amazonian manatees. 
        Guests can learn about manatee rescue efforts, local conservation projects, and 
        the region's delicate ecosystem while seeing these gentle creatures up close.
        </p>
        <p>
        4. Walk the Malecón Tarapacá — This riverside promenade offers lovely sunset views 
        over the Itaya River, as well as charming colonial buildings, cafes, and artisan 
        shops. It's a popular gathering spot for both locals and tourists in the evenings.
        </p>
        <p>
        5. Discover the Pacaya-Samiria National Reserve — As one of the largest protected 
        areas in Peru, this immense reserve is a haven for Amazonian wildlife. Guided 
        multi-day tours let visitors observe rare species, canoe through flooded forests, 
        and experience the untouched beauty of the rainforest.
        </p>
        <p>
        6. Experience Traditional Amazonian Cuisine — Iquitos' food scene is shaped by its 
        jungle setting. Local specialties include juanes (rice and meat wrapped in leaves), 
        paiche (a giant Amazonian fish), and exotic fruits like camu camu and aguaje. Street 
        food stands and traditional restaurants give visitors a chance to sample authentic 
        flavors of the Amazon.
