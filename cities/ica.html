      <h2>Ica</h2>
      <p>
      Nestled in the southern coastal desert of Peru, Ica is a region of sun-soaked 
      sand dunes, fertile valleys, and ancient cultures. Known for its vineyards, 
      archaeological sites, and desert landscapes, Ica offers a different side of 
      Peru beyond the Andes and the Amazon.
      </p>
      <p>
      The city of Ica is the capital of the region, famous for its wine and pisco 
      production — Peru's iconic grape brandy. The nearby Huacachina Oasis, with its 
      shimmering lagoon surrounded by towering sand dunes, is one of the most unique 
      and photogenic destinations in the country.
