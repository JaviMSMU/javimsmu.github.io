        <h2>Lake Titicaca</h2>
        <p>
            Lake Titicaca is the largest lake in South America by volume 
            and surface area, located in the Andes on the border between 
            Peru and Bolivia. It is famously known as the highest 
            navigable lake in the world, sitting at an elevation of about 
            3,812 meters (12,507 feet) above sea level!
        </p>
        <p>
            According to Inca mythology, Lake Titicaca is considered the 
            birthplace of the sun and the Inca civilization itself. The 
            lake is home to many floating islands, ancient archaeological 
            sites, and a rich culture that continues to thrive among its 
            lakeside communities.
