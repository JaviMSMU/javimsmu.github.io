      <h2>Machu Picchu: The Lost City of the Incas</h2>
      <p>
          Machu Picchu is a 15th-century Inca citadel located in the Andes 
          Mountains in Peru. Known for its spectacular views and historical 
          significance, it is one of the most popular tourist destinations 
          in the world. This UNESCO World Heritage site was built by the 
          Incas and later abandoned, only to be rediscovered by explorer 
          Hiram Bingham in 1911.
      </p>
      <p>
          The ancient site is made up of a series of terraces, temples, and 
          plazas, all built using large stone blocks, many of which fit so 
          perfectly that not even a knife blade can slip between them. Machu 
          Picchu is thought to have been a royal retreat for Inca emperors, 
          although its exact purpose remains a mystery.
      </p>

      <h2>How to Get to Machu Picchu</h2>
      <p>
          To reach Machu Picchu, most visitors travel by train from Cusco or 
          Ollantaytambo to Aguas Calientes, a town at the base of the mountain. 
          From there, buses transport travelers up the steep mountain road to 
          the entrance of the site. Alternatively, adventurous hikers can trek 
          the famous Inca Trail, a 4-day hike that leads directly to Machu 
          Picchu. The Inca Trail offers stunning views of the Andes and a 
          chance to explore other Incan ruins along the way.

      <h2>Extra Hiking Adventures</h2>
      <p>
          For those looking to experience more of the area's natural beauty, there 
          are additional hikes near Machu Picchu. The climb to Huayna Picchu is one 
          of the most popular, offering breathtaking views of the ancient citadel 
          below. You can also hike to Machu Picchu Mountain for a higher vantage 
          point of the entire site.
      </p>
      <p>

      <h2>Best Time to Visit</h2>
      <p>
          The best time to visit Machu Picchu is during the dry season, which runs from 
          April to October. This period offers clear skies and pleasant temperatures, 
          making it ideal for hiking and sightseeing. However, Machu Picchu can be 
          crowded during peak months, especially July and August, so it is advisable to 
          plan ahead and book your tickets early.
      </p>

      <p>
          If you want to experience the site with fewer visitors, consider visiting in 
          the shoulder months of April or November, when the weather is still favorable 
          but the crowds are thinner.
