        <h2>Magic Water Circuit</h2>
        <p>
            The Magic Water Circuit (Circuito Mágico del Agua) is one of 
            Lima's most popular attractions and a must-see for visitors 
            to Peru's capital city. Located in the Parque de la Reserva, 
            this impressive park is home to the world's largest fountain 
            complex, a title it holds in the Guinness World Records.
        </p>
        <p>
            Opened in 2007, the park features a series of beautiful 
            fountains, each with its own unique design and lighting 
            effects. At night, the fountains come alive with colorful 
            lights, music, and choreographed water shows that attract 
            both locals and tourists alike.

        <p>
            The park features over a dozen distinct fountains, including 
            the famous Fantasy Fountain, where water dances in time with 
            music and lights, creating a spectacular show. Visitors can 
            also experience interactive fountains, such as the Labyrinth 
            of Dreams, where guests attempt to navigate through a maze of 
            water jets without getting wet.

            2. The Tunnel of Surprises: A 35-meter-long water tunnel that 
            visitors can walk through while being surrounded by arches of water.
        </p>
        <p>
            3. The Labyrinth of Dreams: A fun and interactive fountain maze

            The Magic Water Circuit is an ideal destination for families, couples, 
            and solo travelers alike. The combination of music, technology, and 
            traditional Peruvian motifs in the water shows makes it a unique 
            cultural experience.
        </p>
        <p>
            Located just minutes from Lima's historic center, the park is easily 
            accessible by taxi or public transport. It's open in the afternoons 
            and evenings, with the best time to visit being after sunset when the 
            light and water displays are most vibrant.
